            <p>Leo is a very hyper labradoodle who enjoys running around and meeting new people. Leo recently turned six back in July, and received two toys for his birthday which he has already destroyed. Leo also enjoys laying around the house, his favorite spots being my parents bedroom and the living room couch. 
           <p> Leo is a big fan of when the mailman comes because that means he will get a treat. At bedtime, Leo waits for both of my parents to get into bed before he goes to bed. He thinks he needs to guard them while they are both still awake.</p>
